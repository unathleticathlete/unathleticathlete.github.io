            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <h3>From Bangkok to Uttar Pradesh ‚Äì A story of hustle, passion, and dreams.</h3>
            <p>Hey! I'm Anand Bharti, a 17-year-old who stands tall at 6'4" and weighs 90 kg. Born in Bangkok and raised in Uttar Pradesh, I'm on a journey to become a professional basketball player and the best version of myself ‚Äì physically, mentally, and spiritually.</p>
            <p>I'm all about basketball, but I'm not just shooting hoops ‚Äì I'm working on my dunk, building strength, and aiming to hit every target I set. From draining 3-pointers to mastering my full-court game, I'm bringing the heat! üèÄüí™</p>
            <p>I push myself every day. Whether it's hitting the gym, mastering a new melody on the piano, or grinding on my next basketball move, I'm all in. Life's too short for excuses, and I'm here to win. üé∂</p>

                    <p>My goal? To dunk like the pros, get that perfect jump shot, and make it to the big leagues. I'm working on my jump, my speed, and my strength ‚Äì aiming to be unstoppable on the court. I'm not just trying to play; I'm aiming to dominate.</p>

                    <p>When I'm not on the court, I'm in the studio, creating beats and replicating melodies on my keyboard. I want to be the kind of person who can drop a sick track and still leave defenders in the dust. My beats? Always fire. My basketball moves? Even hotter.</p>
